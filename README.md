Modeling effort for COVID to predict responses to various intervention strategies

For cleanest scripts to fit and simulate -- using a fit but constant intervention strength -- allowing for all options use:
COVID_fit.R
COVID_simulate.R

To fit -- using a continuous intervention strength based on continuous movement data -- allowing for all options use:
COVID_fit_cont.R
